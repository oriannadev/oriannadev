# Orianna Arvelo Ramirez

I build AI pipelines, automation systems, and full-stack applications. Self-taught across the stack — from Linux environments and Docker infrastructure to multi-agent AI orchestration. Currently transitioning from nearly four years of team leadership at Starbucks into remote AI operations and DevOps work.
