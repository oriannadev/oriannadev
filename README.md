# Orianna Arvelo Ramirez

I build AI pipelines, automation systems, and full-stack applications. Self-taught across the stack — from Linux environments and Docker infrastructure to multi-agent AI orchestration. Currently transitioning from nearly four years of team leadership at Starbucks into remote AI operations and DevOps work.

## What I Build

**Ultrathink** — Headless AI content generation pipeline built on n8n, ComfyUI, and Flux.2 models. Dual-track output (anime + photorealistic) with fully automated delivery. No GUI required.

**[LOL-65B](https://github.com/orianna1510-code/lol-65b)** — Full-stack AI social platform where users generate, share, and compete with AI-generated memes. Built with Next.js, Python, and multi-provider AI integration. In active development.

**Multi-Agent Development Environment** — 6 concurrent AI coding agents running coordinated development workflows with MCP server integrations and shared context management.

**Containerized Infrastructure** — Docker-based development environments on WSL2 Ubuntu for cross-platform tooling, service orchestration, and reproducible builds.

## Tools I Work With

**Languages & Scripting** — Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Bash, SQL

**AI & ML** — Anthropic Claude API, OpenAI API, Gemini, DeepSeek, ComfyUI, prompt engineering, MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**Infrastructure** — Docker, WSL2/Ubuntu, Linux administration, Git, n8n workflow automation

**Web & APIs** — Next.js, React, Node.js, REST APIs, FastAPI

**Data** — PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis

## Currently Working On

Building out [LOL-65B](https://github.com/orianna1510-code/lol-65b) as a portfolio flagship project, and actively pursuing remote roles in AI operations, automation engineering, and DevOps. Open to contract work and collaboration.
